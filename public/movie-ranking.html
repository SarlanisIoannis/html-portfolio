<h3>Top Gun</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie so far. I love the action 
and the actress, Tom Cruise is one of the best.</p>
<h3>300</h3>
<p>This movie is based on real events happened in Greece
between the empire of Xerxis and Leonidas with 300 man from Sparta.</p>
<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>It is based on Greek mythology and i like all 
the thoughts of greek people to create and think something like that.</p>
